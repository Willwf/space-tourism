## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Fetch API
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Client-side router
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - Bundler JS

### What I learned

To build this project I had to use everything that I know and a lot more because it wasn't enough. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know and every time that I've tried to change something or to make it better I had to search and learn something different. It was very challenging but I still think that there are a lot of room for improvement. I spent a lot of time searching for answers and ways to better translate what I was thinking to code and was able to build something acceptable. I still continue to change every little detail that I think could be better executed. The variety of layouts for different screen sizes made me understand so many things about css. It's so rich of functionalities, and I know that there's so much to learn yet.
I made a mistake about the use of classes and had my first conflict with css across my components. That made me realize things that I had heard or read before, but didn't really comprehend. To work on the desktop layout I had to use Grid to achieve something similar to the figma layout. It took me so much work to get it done and I still have a feeling that it requires improvement.

### Continued development

I need to keep working with the different hooks on react to fully understand them. And something for my next project is that I want to use styled components just to see the usefulness and learn. I've been able to use flexbox in a satisfying way, but I can't say the same about grid layout, so I'm gonna work on that.

### Useful resources

- [Origamid - Guia CSS Grid Layout](https://www.origamid.com/projetos/css-grid-layout-guia-completo/) - This helped me A LOT to understand the concepts and to implement on css to make it responsive and flexible. This guide saved me so much time. Everything written on it is very detailed.
